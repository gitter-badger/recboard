# recboard - Recommendation models as a service

Recboard aims to provide recommedation models as a service. We use [openrec](http://openrec.ai) (Check it out, its cool!) for modular recommendation systems.

**Objectives:**
Recboard plans to satisfy the following objectives:
- Create recommendation systems on the fly via a UI or a command line tool.
- Visualize model training (running locally or in a remote machine) and results.
- Serve the trained model as a REST API.
